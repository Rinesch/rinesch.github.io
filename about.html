    		<p>During my studies, I worked here as a temporary (20%) iOS Suppporter. My job was to set up iPhone & iPad for internal clients, exchange the devices if they got damaged and teach some basic iOS functionality. I had a lot of direct client contact, which helped me to get better at communicating.</p>

    		<h1 class="timeline-title">Application Developer SharePoint <span class="timeline-work">@ Center for IT services Basel</span></h1>
    		<p>I was put in charge of the SharePoint platform, which was used to create project & team rooms. These were far from standard rooms as they needed a lot of customisation, which included HTML, CSS and JS modifications. My job also included a lot of telephone support, discussing with clients about requirements and preparing & holding presentations. I also got the chance to learn a bit about the Magnolia CMS.</p>

    		<p>As part of my 4th year at IMS I had to do a fulltime internship, which I did here. Mainly, I was doing customer support by telephone and helping out internal teams with their projects. However, I also got to know SharePoint, made first experiences working in a team and broadened my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS.</p>

    <h1 class="about-section-title">About This Site</h1>
    <p class="about-section-content">I created this website with <a class="link" href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and it's hosted on <a class="link" href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, if you're interested in viewing how this site was built, you can view the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/rinesch/rinesch.github.io" target="_blank">site's source</a>.</p>
    <p class="about-section-content last-about">Further, I used <a class="link" href="https://gulpjs.com" target="_blank">Gulp</a> to make the build process easier for minifying and combining assets, but mainly for the livereload, so that I could see my changes directly in the browser without having to hit refresh each time. The <a class="link" href="https://fonts.google.com" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> 'Roboto' and 'Roboto Condensed' are used throughout the website. For the icons I used <a class="link" href="http://www.entypo.com" target="_blank">Entypo Icons</a> and used <a class="link" href="https://icomoon.io" target="_blank">icomoon</a> to generate the icon font.</p>
    <p class="about-section-content last-about">A big inspiration to create this website was my <a class="link" href="https://sacha.me" target="_blank">friend's website</a> and I also used his <a class="link" href="https://sacha.me/SSGS/" target="_blank">SSGS</a> grid system for the layout of this website.</p>
